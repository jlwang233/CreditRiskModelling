## **Project Overview**
The task involves:
1. **Synthetic Data Creation**: Generating a dataset with 10,000 rows and 10+ features relevant to credit risk assessment.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming and aggregating features to improve model performance.
3. **Machine Learning Model Development**: Building and evaluating three credit risk models.
4. **Insights and Conclusion**: Interpreting model results and providing actionable insights.
